# Contributing to Omniscience

Thanks for helping. Bug reports, small focused fixes and new ideas are all welcome.

## Report a bug or ask for a feature
Open an issue with the template. For a bug, include your OS, your Hermes Agent version
(`hermes --version`), the Omniscience version shown in the plugin, the steps, and what you expected.

## Send a change
1. Fork, then branch from `main`.
2. Run the checks before you push:

   ```bash
           python -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   PYTHONPATH=viewer python -m pytest tests -q
   ```
3. Keep the pull request to one logical change, with a test that fails before it and passes after.
   Never weaken a test to make it pass.
4. Describe what changed and why. If the change touches privacy, network calls or capabilities,
   say so in the description — those are reviewed first.

## Ground rules
- Plugins extend Hermes only through public hooks, `ctx.register_*` APIs and the Desktop SDK.
- New Python dependencies need an upper bound (`>=X,<Y`).
- By contributing you agree your work is released under this repository's MIT licence.
- Be kind; see [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
